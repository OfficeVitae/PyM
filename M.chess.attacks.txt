; attacks() determines whether a piece of player with pieces with sign #psign attacks position #prow,#pcol
; this functions is called e.g. by getValidKingMoves() to determine if the king can castle which requires all positions the king passes or occupies are not attacked
; and by isAValidMove() to determine if the King will be attacked as a result of the move
; NOTE attacks() does not check for the en passant capture option, although this would be a valid attacked position
;;out("attacks(psign=",psign,",prow=",prow,",pcol=",pcol,")=")
