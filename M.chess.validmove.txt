; determines whether or not the move from #fromrow,#fromcol to #torow,#tocol is valid
; assumes that the piece at (fromrow,fromcol) can actually be moved to (torow,tocol)
; but might result in being in check

; 1. remember current pieces
piece=board(fromrow,fromcol)
captured=board(torow,tocol)
; 2. move piece
board(torow,tocol)=piece
board(fromrow,fromcol)=0
; 3. determine result
$=len(updatePlayerCheckPieces(if(piece>0,1,2)))>0
; 4. undo move
board(fromrow,fromcol)=piece
board(torow,tocol)=captured
